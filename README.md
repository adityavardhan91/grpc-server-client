# gRPC Server-Client Application

This repository contains a **gRPC Server** and a **gRPC Client** application built using C# and .NET. The applications demonstrate how to use gRPC for efficient communication between services.

## Features
- **gRPC Server**: Exposes remote procedure calls (RPCs) to clients.
- **gRPC Client**: Consumes the services exposed by the gRPC Server.
- Cross-platform support using .NET.
- Efficient, strongly-typed communication using Protocol Buffers.
